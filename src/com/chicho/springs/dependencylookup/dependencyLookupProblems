Problems of Dependency Lookup:
	
There are mainly two problems of dependency lookup.

1. Tight coupling:
The dependency lookup approach makes the code tightly coupled.
If resource is changed, we need to perform a lot of modification in the code.

2. Not easy for testing:
This approach creates a lot of problems while testing the application especially in black box testing.
